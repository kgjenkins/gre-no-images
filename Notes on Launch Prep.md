# Things to watch out for when editing

# Keywords

- keyword link text should match the **name in bold** on the Getty Thesaurus page exactly. For instance, [exedra](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589), [exadrae](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589), [exedrae (interior spaces)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589) should all be [exedrae (interior spaces)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300081589). Note that this is distinct from [exedrae (site elements)]
- The Getty Thesaurus names are always in the plural (`exedrae` not `exedra`). I don't claim that this is better in any sense, but it is a good rule of thumb for checking your keywords: if it's singular, it probably won't match.
- All Getty Thesaurus links should be the page link (http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/0000), not the straight link without the page listing (http://vocab.getty.edu/aat/0000). We want people who click on these to get the nice-looking page, not a datasheet.
