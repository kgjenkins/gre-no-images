The Vesuvian sites form nearly half of the entries at the beta launch but we are just getting started!  

Our first step is to publish the full text of garden entries that Wilhelmina Jashemski  prepared. (Click [here]({{<ref "../history/">}}) for more information on the history of the project.)

Once we accomplish this, we will add gardens discovered in more recent excavations and archive Jashesmki's older entries for those sites. Both versions, however, will remain accessible online.  

Pompeii and Herculaneum are evolving rapidly ... watch this space!
